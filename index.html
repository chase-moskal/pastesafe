				<h2>pastesafe helps people share secrets</h2>
				<p>pastesafe is a free public-key crpyto app that empowers anybody to communicate privately over any untrusted public forum â€” simply by exchanging links packed with encrypted messages</p>
				<p>pastesafe might be handy if you need somebody to send you a password or something like that</p>
				<p>pastesafe works best in <strong>google chrome</strong>, and doesn't work on some phones</p>
				<h3>all pastesafe communications are initiated by an invite link</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>bob wants to receive secret info from alice. so, bob creates a pastesafe session and sends her the invite link</li>
					<li>alice clicks the invite link, and is prompted to enter her secret info for bob</li>
					<li>pastesafe packs the secret response into an encrypted link, which only bob can decode</li>
					<li>alice sends back this new response link, and bob clicks to decode it</li>
				</ol>
